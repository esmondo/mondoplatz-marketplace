# Idea to Content

Take a single idea and turn it into platform-ready content across LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Instagram.

## What this command does

Runs a content production workflow:

1. **Trend check**: Is this topic timely? What angles are working right now?
2. **Hook development**: Find the attention-grabbing framing
3. **Platform adaptation**: Tailor for each platform's format and audience
4. **Quality review**: Check for clarity, accuracy, and engagement potential

## How to use

Provide:
- Your idea (can be rough, just a sentence is fine)
- Your voice/tone preference (or reference a past post you liked)
- Any specific platforms to skip

Example: "I want to talk about how most AI agents fail because they try to do too much"

## Output

You'll receive:
- LinkedIn post (ready to copy-paste)
- Twitter/X thread or single tweet
- Instagram caption + suggested visual direction
- Recommended posting schedule
- Hashtags if relevant

## Tips

- Raw, unpolished ideas often work best
- Contrarian takes get more engagement than obvious observations
- Personal stories beat abstract advice
