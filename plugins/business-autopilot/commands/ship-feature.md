# Ship Feature

Coordinate a complete feature development cycle from concept to deployment.

## What this command does

Runs a structured development workflow:

1. **Validate demand**: Is this worth building? (trend-researcher, feedback-synthesizer)
2. **Prioritize**: When should this ship? (sprint-prioritizer)
3. **Design**: What should it look like? (ui-designer, copywriter)
4. **Build**: Implement it (frontend-developer, backend-architect)
5. **Test**: Is it ready? (test-results-analyzer)
6. **Ship**: Deploy and monitor

## How to use

Provide:
- Feature description (what problem does it solve?)
- Target users (who is this for?)
- Success criteria (how will you know it worked?)
- Deadline (optional, but helpful)

You can start at any stage if earlier stages are already done.

## Output

At each stage you'll receive:
- Deliverables for that phase
- Decision points requiring your input
- Blockers or concerns identified
- Green light to proceed or recommendations to adjust

## When to use

- New feature development
- Significant improvements to existing features
- Technical migrations that affect users
- Anything that needs coordination across design, engineering, and product
